# Happy 20th Anniversary Half-Life 2!

This is a restoration of Half-Life 2's Gordon Freeman model based on the HL2 2003 HEV Suit model (the same one used in 90% of official Gordon renders) and HL2 Survivor Gordon's head.

The 2004 HEV Suit design references are the retail HEV Suit model and the 2004 promotional material, and the 2003 HEV Suit design references are the 2003 suit prop and the 2003 promotional material (mainly Lonely Road).

Gordon's head references are all promotional material I can confirm used the head model, the leaked boxart XSI file screenshot, and the Raising The Bar render.

Huge thanks to Winjon for massively helping out with the textures.  I wouldn't have been able to do it without him.
